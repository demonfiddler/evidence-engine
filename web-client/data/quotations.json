Because the climate is complex and poorly understood, our model predicts that global average temperatures will not change.",

If we are seriously going to reduce that on farms, we’re going to have to reduce our tractor usage and that means we must go to no-till agriculture, which means using glyphosate and adopting GM crops. You hate those two things more than you actually hate CO2.\r\n\r\nThen of course we've got the other juxtaposition on nitrous oxide. We produce nitrous oxide by growing leguminous crops.
