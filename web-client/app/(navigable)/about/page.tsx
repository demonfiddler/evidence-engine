      </div>
      <h2>Evidence Engine version 0.1</h2>
      <p>Evidence Engine is a web-based client-server application for managing evidence on arbitrary scientific topics.</p>
      <p>The application is a generalised rewrite of the Campaign Resources Climate Science&nbsp;
        <a href="https://github.com/demonfiddler/climate-science-client/" target="_blank">Client</a> and&nbsp;
        <a href="https://github.com/demonfiddler/climate-science-server/" target="_blank">Server</a>&nbsp;
        (see the Campaign Resources <a href="https://campaign-resources.org/climate" target="_blank">climate page</a>&nbsp;
        and the online <a href="https://campaign-resources.org/climate-science-client/" target="_blank">climate science database</a>).
        Evidence Engine can address any arbitrary topics for which evidence can be evinced.</p>

      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <p>
        Evidence Engine is a complex application that presents large lists with linked detail panels.
        It works best on large form-factor devices such as desktop computers and high-resolution tablets.
        It is really not suitable for use on mobile phones but if you absolutely insist on using one, at least orient it in landscape mode with auto-rotate active!
      </p>

      <h2>Technical</h2>
      <p>
        The Java server is based on <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot" target="_blank">Spring Boot</a>&nbsp;
        with <a href="https://www.graphql-java.com/" target="_blank">GraphQL-Java</a> and manages a&nbsp;
        <a href="https://mariadb.com/" target="_blank">MariaDB</a> relational database containing
        scientific evidence of various categories. The API is based on&nbsp;
        <a href="https://graphql.org/" target="_blank">GraphQL</a> over HTTP. Both Java client and Java server use
        customised code generated by <a href="https://github.com/graphql-java-generator" target="_blank">GraphQL Java Generator</a>.
        The web client uses <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank">Next.js</a>,&nbsp;
        <a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank">React</a>,&nbsp;
        <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a>,&nbsp;
        <a href="https://tailwindcss.com" target="_blank">TailwindCSS</a>,&nbsp;
        <a href="https://www.apollographql.com" target="_blank">Apollo GraphQL</a> and the&nbsp;
        <a href="https://ui.shadcn.com/" target="_blank">ShadCN</a> component library. The application is built using
        the <a href="https://gradle.com/" target="_blank">Gradle Build System</a>.
