Publication[Input].date|.year: do we need both?
PublicationInput.authorNames|.authorIds: do we need both?
TopicRef.locations (topic_<ITopicalEntity>_ref.locations): does this have any meaning for Claim, Declaration, Person or Quotation?

Whether to enforce a topic link at entity creation time?

Interpretation of filter values
- What does a null value mean? Note: this only applies to optional filter fields relating to nullable database columns.
    TopicQueryFilter.parentId = null:
        - 1.) select only top-level parents, or 2.) don't filter on parentId at all?
        if 1.), leaves no way to select all topics
        if 2.), leaves no way to select only top-level topics
        Since we need to be able to do both 1.) and 2.), this means we need a way to distinguish between the two cases. Possible solutions:
        A. Use an otherwise impossible magic ID value to signify a null match (e.g., -1 for IDs)
        This would be a bit contrived and maybe counterintuitive but it would work.
        B. Supply an additional mask (e.g., bitmask) in the filter to indicate which filter fields should be applied.
        This would be an onerous and error-prone requirement, especially when multiple fields are involved.
    TopicQueryFilter.text
        Specify the empty string to signify a null match.
    TrackedEntityQueryFilter.text
        Specify the empty string to signify a null match.
    TopicalEntityQueryFilter.topicId
