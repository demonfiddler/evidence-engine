	/**
	 * Description for the kind field: <br/>
	 * The publication kind. <br/>
	 * Loads the data for Publication.kind. It may return whatever is accepted by the Spring Controller, that is:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>A resolved value of any type (typically, a String)</li>
	 * <li>Mono and Flux for asynchronous value(s). Supported for controller methods and for any DataFetcher as
	 * described in Reactive DataFetcher. This would typically be a Mono&lt;String&gt; or a Flux&lt;String&gt;</li>
	 * <li>Kotlin coroutine and Flow are adapted to Mono and Flux</li>
	 * <li>java.util.concurrent.Callable to have the value(s) produced asynchronously. For this to work,
	 * AnnotatedControllerConfigurer must be configured with an Executor. This would typically by a
	 * Callable&lt;String&gt;</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * As a complement to the spring-graphql documentation, you may also return:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>A CompletableFuture<?>, for instance CompletableFuture<String>. This allows to use
	 * <A HREF="https://github.com/graphql-java/java-dataloader">graphql-java java-dataloader</A> to highly optimize the
	 * number of requests to the server. The principle is this one: The data loader collects all the data to load, avoid
	 * to load several times the same data, and allows parallel execution of the queries, if multiple queries are to be
	 * run.</li>
	 * <li>A Publisher (instead of a Flux), for Subscription for instance</li>
	 * </ul>
	 * @param dataFetchingEnvironment The GraphQL {@link DataFetchingEnvironment}. It gives you access to the full
	 * GraphQL context for this DataFetcher
	 * @param origin The object from which the field is fetch. In other word: the aim of this data fetcher is to fetch
	 * the kind attribute of the <I>origin</I>, which is an instance of {ObjectType {name:Publication,
	 * fields:{Field{name:id, type:ID!, params:[]},Field{name:status, type:String,
	 * params:[format:FormatKind]},Field{name:created, type:DateTime, params:[]},Field{name:createdByUser, type:User,

	 * type:String, params:[]},Field{name:accessed, type:Date, params:[]}}, implements
	 * IBaseEntity,ITrackedEntity,ILinkableEntity, comments ""}. It depends on your data model, but it typically contains
	 * the id to use in the query.
	 * @param format The input parameter sent in the query by the GraphQL consumer, as defined in the GraphQL schema.
	 * @throws NoSuchElementException This method may return a {@link NoSuchElementException} exception. In this case,
	 * the exception is trapped by the calling method, and the return is consider as null. This allows to use the
	 * {@link Optional#get()} method directly, without caring of whether or not there is a value. The generated code
	 * will take care of the {@link NoSuchElementException} exception.
